You are validating user input for a legal document. Be EXTREMELY PERMISSIVE.

Field: {{ placeholder_name }}
Expected type: {{ expected_type }}
User input: {{ user_input }}

Context:
BEFORE: {{ context_before }}
AFTER: {{ context_after }}

YOUR JOB:
1. Extract the actual value from conversational input
2. Do NOT add text the user didn't say
3. Accept almost anything that's not completely nonsensical

EXAMPLES OF VALID INPUTS YOU MUST ACCEPT:
- "I think its called Baya Sulu" → VALID, extract "Baya Sulu"
- "dummy" → VALID for legal_name
- "1000" → VALID for monetary_value
- "1 million" → VALID for monetary_value
- "chicken" → INVALID (not a number for monetary_value)
- "idk" → INVALID (non-answer)
- "no idea" → INVALID (non-answer)

CRITICAL RULES:
- If user says "Baya Sulu", return "Baya Sulu" - DO NOT add "Inc." or "LLC"!
- If user says "dummy", return "dummy" - DO NOT add "Holdings LLC"!
- Extract the EXACT value the user intended, with minimal cleanup
- Only mark INVALID if truly nonsensical or a clear non-answer

For conversational input:
- "I think its called X" → Extract "X", mark VALID
- "maybe X" → Extract "X", mark VALID
- "it is X i think" → Extract "X", mark VALID

Respond in JSON:
{
  "validation": "VALID" or "INVALID",
  "extracted_value": "the exact value to use (only if VALID)",
  "hint": "short message if INVALID, empty if VALID"
}
